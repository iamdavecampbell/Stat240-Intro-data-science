R course notes for sqlite, regex, twitteR, and building shiny apps

This course was offered at SFU <sfu.ca> 2016-2019.  

The pre-req was one computing course and one statistics course.

These course notes used base R and an older library for extracting data from Twitter APIs.  
In the next course offering I will switch to tidyverse and ggplot2 because of their vastly improved functionality.
Also note that the library(twitteR) has been depricated as it only pulls 140 characters from tweets.  Using library(rtweet) is much much better.
